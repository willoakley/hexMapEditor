hexMapEditor
============

2D editor for hex maps. Aka me playing with HTML5's canvas.

Eventually for use in planning battletech campaigns with the various scenery I've built.

To export the satelite view as an image requires the application to be hosted otherwise the locally loaded images will be treated as cross-domain and the canvas export will fail.
